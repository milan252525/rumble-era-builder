          Custom eras are created by users and can only be played on the server where they are
          uploaded. Access is controlled by server staff, they are not unlocked by users. For more

          Custom eras are a premium feature that require an active subscription. This subscription
          supports the necessary customer support, moderation, and reviews for custom eras.
          Additionally, by purchasing the subscription you support further development and our team!
          If you aren't able to get the subscription and you have a big and interesting server,
          reach out to us to discuss potential alternatives.

          <strong>Official</strong> eras are created by the Rumble Royale team. Official eras
          contain unlockable content and are tied to the bot progression. Items and their skins are
          obtainable in season passes, backpacks or purchasable. Once you unlock the era, you can
          start it in any server. The era always has one item available to everyone and the rest has
          to be unlocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Custom</strong> eras are purely cosmetic and server specific. All weapons in the
          era are unlocked for everyone by default. Custom eras are started through a separate
          command and it's entirely on the specific server staff team to allow or deny access to
          members. Rumble Royale team isn't responsible for those eras, but they are still subject
          to moderation and our rules.

          subscription for the wrong server, contact us, and we will refund it. If you wish to
          change the server after a longer period, cancel the current subscription and start a new
